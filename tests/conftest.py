"""Pytest bootstrap.

Normal development/CI: `requirements.test.txt` installs the real
`homeassistant`, `voluptuous` and `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`
packages, and this file does nothing extra beyond making the repo root
importable.

`tests/_stubs` only exists for environments with no PyPI access at all
(that's how these pure-logic tests were first written and verified here).
It is a deliberately minimal stand-in for the handful of homeassistant
symbols models.py/store.py/manager.py touch -- NOT a replacement for the
real test suite. It is only added to sys.path (and only as a low-priority
fallback, appended at the end) when the real `homeassistant` package isn't
installed, so it can never shadow the real package in normal CI.
